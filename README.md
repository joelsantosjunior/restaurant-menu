# Veggie Bistro
The project was created to serve as an in-place menu for restaurants and bars

# About the Project

**Veggie Bistro** is a virtual menu, for a vegan restaurant, the proposal is that this service is used in-place, from a tablet or smartphone. The idea is that the customer, upon arriving at the establishment, finds a QR code that redirects them to the Menu site, where the order can be placed and automatically sent to the kitchen of the establishment as well as to the responsible waiter.

The images in the project, as well as the content of the dishes, were generated by AI to bring more originality to the project, seeking to simulate a real-world environment.

Below is the user journey:

- The user scans the QRCode
- The user views the dishes
- The user chooses a dish and adds it to the cart
- The user finalizes the order

# Technologies used

- React
- React Router DOM
- React-Redux
- styled-components
- Typescript
- Vite

# Functional Requirements

Due to time constraints (2 days to complete the project) some non-essential functional requirements were not met so features with greater value delivery were done, such as translation and cart.

- [x]  View Menu
- [x]  View individual items
- [x]  Add Item to cart
- [x]  Update cart
- [x]  View Order
- [x]  Quick access menu
- [x]  Content translation
- [x]  Interface translation
- [ ]  Restaurant Information
- [ ]  Unit Tests

Disclaimer: The monetary internationalization, although requested, was not included in the scope of this project, as it is not necessary, since the proposal is that the Menu is used in-place when visiting the establishment, therefore, there is no functional need to do currency conversion.

Disclaimer 2: Unit tests were not done due to the time stipulated for project delivery, however, I would choose to write unit tests, especially for two items that I consider more important: cart logic and translation logic.

# Non-Functional Requirements

- [x]  Responsiveness (Tablet & Mobile phone)

# Development

The project was developed in stages, starting with the construction of the user interface, visual elements, colors, and typography definition.

Then the technologies to be used were defined, as well as the organization of folders and project architecture.

## User Interface

The following tools were used for the development of the user interface:

- Figma - Prototyping
- Google Fonts - Typography
- StabilityAI, DreamStudio - Generate images for the dishes
- ChatGPT - Generate files with dishes and drinks in a format that simulates the sending of data by a REST API

## User Experience

The prototyped visual elements are basic elements of an interface for this type of service, with buttons, cards representing menu items, and Modals for viewing information such as orders and items. In addition, a fixed bar is positioned at the end of the page, for quick access to the order, table information, and the total spent.

The translation works automatically depending on the device's internal language preferences, in addition to that, A toggle button was created at the top of the page, for the user to switch between the available languages. 

A top Menu was added that becomes fixed when scrolling, allowing quick access to all item categories in the restaurant.

The Order view button is only displayed if there is at least one item in the order, as well as the total order.

Small labels have been added that inform if the food is gluten-free or lactose-free.
